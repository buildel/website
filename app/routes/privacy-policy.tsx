          <p>
            The services are provided by EL Passion Next sp. z o.o., with its
            registered seat at: Krakowskie Przedmieście 13, 00-071 Warszawa,
            Warsaw, Poland (“EL Passion”). This Privacy Policy applies to the
            processing of your personal data, as well as the use of "cookie"
            files and similar technologies while you use buildel.ai (“Website”),
            app.buildel.ai (“Web app”)
          </p>
          <h2>Your Privacy is important to us!</h2>
          <p>
            We recognize that your privacy is very important to you and that it
            is your right to control and be informed about the information we
            process about you and how we process it. We know that providing
            personal data is an act of trust, and we take that trust seriously.
            We will never sell, rent, or otherwise disclose your personal data,
            except as outlined in this Privacy Policy, provided that we have an
            appropriate legal basis for such disclosure.
          </p>
          <p>
            By subscribing to our Services, you agree to be bound by this
            Privacy Policy. This is our entire and exclusive Privacy Policy, and
            it supersedes any earlier version. This Privacy Policy forms part of
            and should be read in conjunction with our Terms and Conditions
            available <a href="/terms-and-conditions">here</a>.
          </p>
          <h3>1. Categories of personal data</h3>
          <p>
            Conclusion and performance of the Terms and Conditions involve
            personal data processing (e-mail address) of natural persons (your
            proxies, representatives, employees, contractors, etc.) transferred
            by the Client to EL Passion. This can include personal data of the
            Client himself/herself when a Client is a natural person. We process
            your personal data provided at the point of registration (e-mail
            address) for the purpose of enabling your user access to our
            services.
          </p>
          <p>
            Insofar as the performance of the Terms and Conditions involves the
            processing of personal data of Client’s representatives, employees,
            contractors, etc., the Client acknowledges that this Privacy Policy
            is applicable to such processing and undertakes to provide such
            representatives, employees, contractors, etc. with its content.
          </p>
          <h3>2. Purposes and legal basis</h3>
          <p>
            The processing of such data by EL Passion necessary for the purpose
            of managing our client relationship, concluding and performing the
            Terms and Conditions (including contacting for marketing purposes,
            unless EL Passion receives an objection to such processing), as well
            as exercising all the rights and obligations relating to the
            performance of the Terms and Conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            In processing your data, we pursue our legitimate interest in (i)
            direct marketing of our services, (ii) enabling the provision of our
            services based on the Terms and Conditions, (iii) exercising our
            contractual and legal rights and obligations. If the Client is a
            natural person, we process the personal data based on the contract,
            i.e. the processing is necessary for the conclusion and performance
            of the contract, to which the data subject is a party.
          </p>
          <p>
            Provision of personal data is voluntary, but if you don’t provide us
            with the basic personal data, we will not be able to conclude the
            Terms and Conditions with the Client or contact the Client in
            connection with the provision of services pursuant to the Terms and
            Conditions.
          </p>
          <h3>3. Your rights</h3>
          <p>
            You have the right to object to the processing of your data by us
            and to request that we correct or delete your data. If you file such
            a request we will stop processing your data and delete it, unless
            there exists an important overriding legal interest (e.g. defense of
            claims or existence of a legal obligation to retain the data) that
            will entitle us to keep your data for a longer period. You also have
            the right of access to your data, as well as the right to data
            portability and to restriction of the processing.
          </p>
          <h3>4. Retention periods </h3>
          <p>
            We process your personal data only for as long as necessary for the
            purposes, for which it was collected. As a general rule, we will
            process personal data for as long as we have a contractual
            relationship with the Client and/or for as long as you remain the
            contact person or employee/contractor of the Client, whichever is
            the earliest. We will also process the data after the termination of
            the contractual relationship, for the duration of the statutory
            period of 3 years. We may have to process personal data for a longer
            period of time in limited circumstances, i.e. in case we need to
            defend against legal claims.
          </p>
          <h3>5. Sharing your personal data with third parties</h3>
          <p>
            We entrust the processing of your personal data to entities, which
            act on our behalf and solely based on our instructions (data
            processors). In particular, we use data processors, whom we select
            carefully, to store your data on secure servers located within the
            territory of the EU. In the event that personal data is entrusted
            for further processing to subprocessors outside the EEA, we ensure
            that appropriate safeguards (in particular Standard Contractual
            Clauses) are in place to ensure the legality of such transfer and
            the security of your data.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may have to share your personal data with competent authorities
            (in particular the police or prosecution service), if they approach
            us with such a request, provided that there exists an appropriate
            legal basis for making your personal data available to them (e.g. a
            court order).
          </p>
          <h3>6. Contact</h3>

            We may periodically be required to make changes to our Privacy
